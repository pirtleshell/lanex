# Laniakean Explorer

For more than 5 years now, I've played around with web technologies behind the scenes working on a single project. I've built and rebuilt the same things dozens of times. Over this course of time, I've made pages in vanilla HTML, Angular, React, and even a [custom markdown parser](https://github.com/pirtleshell/lanex-renderer). I've rewritten the app from a static site to being server-side rendered, from vanilla React to frameworks like Next.js; I used gulp, & browserify, & ultimately, webpack. I've rewritten the API from node on top of a SQL database to node on top of mongo back and back again; I've built it in Django, I've implemented GraphQL, I wrote the damn thing in vanilla PHP.

After all this time I have learned A TON about all sorts of technologies and design patterns and architectural do's and dont's. But I never really committed to making the project I initially set out to. [Laniakean.com](https://laniakean.com/) is still the Angular site I wrote in 2016 atop an API in PHP before I ever really even knew what I was doing..

So here I am again... attempting to build it once more. Maybe I'll steal bits from my past attempts, maybe it'll all be rewritten again... One thing is for sure though, I will continue to learn! This time around it'll be a static site in Gatsby.
